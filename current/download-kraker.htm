<b>Release notes for v4c (August 1, 2022)</b>
<p>
All of the information concerning this update is in the documentation. Two security vulnerabilies have been fixed and
some specifications have been changed. Some information that was previously missing from the documentation is now
included. The documentation is complete and final. Hopefully, I haven't missed anything and there won't be a need
for fixes for a long time to come.

<b>Release notes for v4b (June 13, 2022)</b>
<p>
This is a revision of v4a with no feature changes. The major improvement over previous versions of Kraker is in the
management of sockets on all ports, especially ports 8080/8081 which now feature socket reuse for faster performance.
This feature is also used for DNS-over-HTTPS. As well, ports 8080/8081 are now routed through the Socks5 proxy to take
advantage of redirection (such as through TOR). Third-party proxy servers are also supported. The documentation has
also been updated to cover all of the technical capabilities of the proxy server.
