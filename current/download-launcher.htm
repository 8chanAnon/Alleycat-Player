If you do not already have the <g_>Kraker Local Proxy Server</g_> installed then please follow these
<a href="installation-v2.htm">instructions</a> for installing <g_>Alleycat Player</g_>. It is not absolutely necessary
for the use of the Launcher app but it is recommended for full functionality (including auto-updating and posting).

<b>Release notes for v2e (August 23, 2022)</b>
<ul><li>
Fixed broken embeds and added catalog view.
</li><li>
Posting now requires the Kraker Local Proxy Server with a shadow port.
</li><li>
Can now post as board moderator. Can edit posts and ban IPs. Limited functionality for deletions.
</li></ul>

<b>Release notes for v2d (November 13, 2021)</b>
<ul><li>
<b>Important New Feature:</b> Any Slice that is in a thread that is auto-updating will also be
auto-updated. This allows you to follow a conversation or track the reponses to an important post in real time.
Great feature for bakers.
</li><li>
The Post Office will now display the new post number after posting. The input fields will no longer be cleared by default.
There is a checkbox at the lower right to enable auto-clear. Also, the number of posts is increased from 5 to 6.
</li><li>
Added an event handler to block double-clicks on the status bar. This allows for the rapid reactivation
of the menu bar (useful in the Post Office).
</li><li>
Corrected the flawed truncation of long titles in the status bar. The new CSS will now truncate long titles
correctly when the browser is resized.
</li><li>
I found another strange behaviour on Chrome-based browsers. Zooming is blocked if a new tab is opened without a URL.
The fix is to open the tab with the URL "about:blank". This behaviour is totally unexpected. As I stated before,
I use Firefox so funky Chrome issues often get missed.
</li><li>
Setting the proxy to "None" was causing an exception (internal Javascript crash). Sorry about that but who uses "None" anyway?
</li></ul>

<b>Release notes for v2c (October 20, 2021)</b>
<ul><li>
Ooops. I just noticed that the page width setting wasn't working. Been like that for a while but it's fixed now.
</li><li>
Changed the media server from "images.128ducks.com" to "media.128ducks.com". The changeover occurred early Wednesday,
October 20.
</li><li>
The Post Office feature is now fully implemented. It includes the ability to create new threads and to manage 5 posts
per instance.
</li><li>
It is now possible to copy the text from the status bar without causing the menu bar to open.
</li><li>
I can't get the XMLHttpRequest module to give progress reports for file uploads. It does not work correctly on any
browser. I searched the net for a possible solution but it appears that the module is just funky. It does not function
correctly on the default 8kun client either.
</li></ul>

<b>Release notes for v2b (October 13, 2021)</b>
<ul><li>
Fixed wrong button appearance on Pale Moon and Waterfox. I used an outline rather than a border around the buttons
in the status bar. The outline was being drawn square instead of rounded.
</li><li>
Fixed three issues on Chrome-based browsers (Google, Brave, Opera and others): 1) slow countdown timer,
2) missing bread titles, 3) images appearing on the right when they should be on the left
</li><li>
Removed the dark border around the text area in the Quick Reply box. I missed this because I have a userContent CSS
on my Firefox that does that. The fix is to specify "outline:none" in the CSS for the &lt;textarea&gt; element.
</li><li>
I am working on the Post Office feature. Give me a week or so.
</li></ul>

<b>Release notes for v2a (October 9, 2021)</b>
<ul><li>
This is a major upgrade. The Bread Launcher now supports auto-updating and posting. At present, only one image or file
is allowed in a post (Quick Reply). The text input is unlimited but constrained to a small window. A more complete
post editor will come soon (I will be calling it the Post Office).
</li><li>
The Youtube embed links stopped working because YT doesn't like the blank "referer" HTTP header so I removed the
"no-referrer" meta setting.
</li></ul>
