# Special Note

This repository was deleted and then rebuilt on June 9, 2022 due to a DMCA notice which complained about a live TV link in the Alleycat Player files. I deleted or modified the affected files. Unfortunately, the DMCA notice contained links to the historical versions of the files so my attempt to pacify the DMCA notice was unsuccessful. The method for deleting history is long and convoluted because it requires installing Python or Java-based tools with which I have zero familiarity. I could not install or use the tools to remove the history. Deleting and rebuilding the repository was the easier option.
