<b>Release notes for v3a (March 19, 2020)</b> -- <a href="alleycat-player-v3a.htm">source</a>
<p>
Major update today. The new video controls are done. Slick if I do say so myself (and I do). The main feature is the seek
function with 6 presets (5s, 15s, 1m, 2m, 5m, 10m) and a freeform input which can accept either h:m:s format or just a
plain number of seconds. Fractional values work too. Precede the number with a "+" or a "-" to seek from the current
play time. For example, "+0.1" will allow you to seek ahead one tenth of a second for those times when you need to find the
perfect spot to take a snapshot (of course, you need to pause the video but I don't really have to point that out, do I?).
<p>
You'll also find your viewing experience a bit more pleasant without that spinning icon popping up in the middle
of your video every time there is a hiccup in the network feed. Instead, the control bar will show itself to signal the
status of the feed after two seconds so you don't need to put up with annoying and constant feedback. After all, you do
know that the video is not working without being told. It might help you to know that hitting the 5s seek preset will
usually get a stalled video going again.
<p>
You can also adjust the brightness and saturation but the implementation is very basic. Use the main controls unless you
are in fullscreen mode or in a window. Lastly, you can rotate the video. Watch your vids upside down for a new experience.
<p>
Quick tip: The status bar in the middle of the viewer is now clickable (where you see the "No Video" message).
It will pop up the current stack if one is active (the "Allow Multiple" option is ignored). The reason why the whole viewer space is not clickable has to do with
the nature of an <i>iframe</i>. There is, of course, some sort of solution but I haven't figured it out yet and I am fed up
of trying.
<ul><li>
Added Periscope. Not tested with live feeds. Weirdly, Periscope vids are rotated sideways. This is handled by the new video
control.
</li><li>
The main source for most of the secondary US feeds (123tvnow.com) has changed the format of the video URLs. This is fixed.
Besides that, very little has changed. A few Internet TV channels had to be replaced but nothing that anybody should care
about. That's good because I'm tired of all the churn lately.
</li></ul>

<b>Release notes for v3b (March 29, 2020)</b> -- <a href="alleycat-player-v3b.htm">source</a>
<p>
At some point, I will have to remove the old release notes. For now, I am leaving them since they contain some valuable
information.
<p>
Mozilla Firefox 74.0 has broken the CORS bypass extensions. However, this is only true if Alleycat Player is loaded from
the local drive. The extensions still work if Alleycat is loaded from "archive.org". This
<a target=_blank href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2020-08/#CVE-2020-6809">security advisory</a>
appears to be the relevant justification (which I don't understand). Perhaps this will happen to Chrome as well or maybe
Mozilla will wise up to a better solution. The developer of "CORS Everywhere" has stated that this breakage appears to be
unfixable. That is unfortunate since I use that extension for testing Internet TV links.
<p>
I should write some words about how the Kraker Local Proxy Server deals with CORS blockage and other accessibility
issues. Let's start with this working example of an Internet TV channel blocked by CORS:
<p>
<g_>http://localhost:8080/~http://hitmusic.hu/hitmusic.m3u8</g_>
<p>
The channel will work just fine without Kraker on VLC or SMPlayer or if you use a browser extension
for m3u8 playback. The CORS issue appears ONLY if you try to run the channel in Alleycat Player. The browser will load
the file alright but it will disallow access by Alleycat because the server has not set the HTTP header
"access-control-allow-origin" to "*". Kraker will set the header to "*" so that the browser will allow access.
The tilde (~) simply informs Kraker that it should handle the request in "passthrough" mode so that the console
does not get clogged with messages. That is, a message is printed to the console only every 30 seconds rather than for
every request.
<p>
Some channels do not work quite so easily. The segment URLs contained in the m3u8 will work just fine if they
are relative URLs, meaning that the domain serving the video segments is the same as the one serving the m3u8. If absolute
URLs are used in the m3u8 (whether or not they are in a different domain) then the video player will try to load the
segments directly without going through Kraker. For this reason, Kraker has an option to "fix" the m3u8. The option is
activated in this manner:
<p>
<g_>http://localhost:8080/~*,,*http://video.blivenyc.com/broadcast/prod/2061/22/desktop-playlist.m3u8</g_>
<p>
There is more to the double-comma syntax but that is not relevant here. The asterisks delineate a "referer" URL (see the
release notes for v2d). Though this particular example is not referer-locked, the default referer string would be
"http://video.blivenyc.com/". If a different referer is needed, then the URL would look like this:
<p>
<g_>http://localhost:8080/~*www.nasa.gov,,*https://nasa-i.akamaihd.net/hls/live/253565/NASA-NTV1-Public/master.m3u8</g_>
<p>
There is a shortcut if you want to play a channel without the need to type in the "localhost" part:
<p>
<g_>~7:*http://1music.hu/1music.m3u8</g_> or <g_>~8:*http://1music.hu/1music.m3u8</g_>
<p>
<b>Some really weird shit going on with HTML/CSS rendering</b>
<p>
You may have noticed this. Some versions of Alleycat Player or Youtube Player don't seem to have the problem but the
problem does exist with Alleycat v3a. If you click between the Info Viewer and the News Viewer, the two viewers do not
line up. The symptoms can vary. Buttons or text may appear to move up or down a pixel. The entire viewer may move. It is
bizarre and has caused me a lot of frustration. I have finally nailed it down. First of all, the CSS for the buttons had
to be revised to balance these four attributes: height, line-height, font-size and padding. There was nothing wrong with
my CSS. The browsers have some bugs. I think what is happening is that browsers create the page in multiple layers:
background, borders and text. The layers may not align exactly due to half-pixel errors so elements may be drawn out of
alignment when the layers are combined.
<p>
This caused me much grief with the updated video controls. The text was not being drawn precisely between the borders but
this error was occurring in only one or two of the viewers and never in all three. So the issue was impossible to resolve
by just tweaking the CSS. To make a long story short, the solution involved introducing a half-pixel error in between
the Info Viewer and the News Viewer. Don't believe me? Click the link below. The Javascript will revoke the half-pixel
error and bring you to the Info Viewer. Switch between the viewers to see the result. In Firefox, the "Raw/Wrapper/Sandbox"
text and the background for the "No Video" text will move. In the Chrome-based browsers, the entire viewer
will move. Come back here and click the link again to see the problem get fixed.
<p>
<g_>Reverse the half-pixel error:</g_> <a href="javascript:testit()">click here</a>
<p>
I am testing this on Windows 10 with Firefox, Waterfox, Google Chrome, Brave and Opera. The fix works for all of them
despite the fact that the symptoms are different. I do not have access to Linux or any other platform for testing so your
mileage may vary. This is the HTML code containing the half-pixel error:
<p>
<g_>&lt;div id="test" style="width: 90vw; height: 250.5px"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</g_>
<p>
I have written several paragraphs of text here and it has not affected the viewers. This is beyond my comprehension and
it has given me a colossal headache.
<ul><li>
Added a speed control and made a few other improvements to the video control bar. Some sort of keyboard interface is on
the list of things to do.
</li><li>
"153news.net" is gone as of March 22. Someone stole the server from the data centre. For details:
<a href="http://abovetopsecret.is/153news-net-offline-raided/">article</a> and
<a href="https://invidio.us/channel/UCJd3MyWFy4f3sIOeycp4UdA">Jason's Youtube channel</a>.
</li><li>
Nancy Web TV will be offline until the coronavirus panic is over. WTF?
</li><li>
TV Ontario is back up. The same source (www.arconaitv.us) is now the primary feed for CTV News.
</li><li>
Removed the secondary feed for OAN (still searching for more sources). All of the "ustv.to" sources are currently
working with a remote proxy.
</li><li>
Updated Periscope. Some videos were found to need an m3u8 fixup. Also, the same videos were found to NOT be rotated.
Don't know yet how to differentiate between rotated and non-rotated videos.
</li><li>
I don't know what is going on with VidNode. I'm not having issues with it but sometimes Alleycat gets an mp4 and other
times it gets an m3u8. I prefer the latter because I can get the 360p resolution. My CPU is overworked at higher
resolutions unless I use SMPlayer. Whatever. I'm getting m3u8 right now. Also, the download links often (usually?)
don't work.
</li></ul>

<b>Release notes for v3c (April 6, 2020)</b> -- <a href="alleycat-player-v3c.htm">source</a>
<p>
Previous iteration of v3c was revoked. This is the correct version.
<p>
The US Internet TV sources changed again. This fix will hopefully be stable for a while. A remote proxy will no longer
work for these channels but a CORS unblocker will (see the v3b release notes regarding Firefox 74.0). At the time of this
writing, OAN is down.
<p>
<b>Release notes for v3c (April 5, 2020)</b>
<p>
The sources for most of the Internet TV channels in the US (ustv247.tv, ustvgo.tv, watchnewslive.tv) have undergone
another update after having been down for three days. The Local Proxy Server is required to access these channels due to
the need to handle cookies and also a Referer Lock. The actual channel feed (new domain: ustv24h.live) is not restricted
in any way.
<p>
My previous comments regarding pixel misalignment in the viewers might have struck some people as odd because it is likely
that the "half-pixel error" test link did not work for you. Well, it turns out that the error factor varies depending on
screen resolution and zoom factor. The test actually works but the correct error factor for your system can be anything
from 0.1 to 0.9. At normal zoom and 1024x768 resolution, the error factor of 0.5 works perfectly for me across different
browsers but does not work if I change either the zoom or the resolution. Weird. Very weird. I have no solution to this
problem. On the bright side, I am no longer seeing any misalignment errors with the video controls. Knock on wood?
<ul><li>
Updated UniqueStream. Removed WillTV because the site now requires a login.
</li><li>
Updated the video controls to include a "flip horizontal" option.
</li></ul>

<p><hr><p>
<b>Release notes for v3d (April 11, 2020)</b> -- <a href="alleycat-player-v3d.htm">source</a>
<p>
Youtube fixed the bug with signed videos which was patched in v2f. The extra step 4 is no longer needed.
<p>
I am still not getting any feedback on Alleycat Player. Nobody is checking my home page on archive.org to find that I do
have a place where you can offer feedback. The address is now available at the top of this page. As I have mentioned before,
I only have a minimal Win10 system available to me for testing. No bad-ass video card. No widescreen monitor. Just a
really basic system. I have been doing my best to guess how Alleycat Player will perform on other systems but I can only
go so far without feedback.
<p>
On my list of things-to-do: keyboard video controls and ability to save m3u8 videos as mp4. The former is low
priority. I really want to get that second feature working as soon as possible. I know it can be done but I'm not
sure how yet. I am not planning to do the same for DASH videos.
<p>
It is important to use your browser's zoom feature to fit Alleycat Player to your browser window. This works pretty well
(as far as I can tell) but the faux speaker grill on the right-hand side might still be visible because you don't have
exact control over the zoom factor. I have added a feature to "snap" the grill out of view when it reaches a certain
minimum width. Hope this works as intended.
<ul><li>
Added PagalMovies. This is a source for Bollywood and Hindi movies but many English films are there too.
</li><li>
Updated MixDrop to allow for a wider range of ID lengths. I have seen IDs of length 5 and all the way to 15. The default
algorithm for separating ID numbers from a URL doesn't work for such a wide range.
</li><li>
Added a secondary feed for OAN.
</li></ul>

<b>Release notes for v3e (April 20, 2020)</b> -- <a href="alleycat-player-v3e.htm">source</a>
<p>
<ul><li>
Fixed the primary and secondary feeds for the US Internet TV channels. The feeds from 123tvnow.com were previously
hard-wired. It is now necessary to hit the site for the feeds. The "crypto.js" module supplied with kraker-1c is
being used for this purpose.
</li><li>
Updated XHamster. Download links removed from VidNode because they don't work.
</li><li>
Removed TV Ontario because the source is broken.
