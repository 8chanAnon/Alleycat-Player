<h3><r_>Using and configuring the Socks5 Tunnel Proxy Server</r_></h3>
<p><hr><p>
It is called a "Tunnel Proxy" because all it does (or can do) is apply a custom DNS lookup and then route the
connection to the required destination. It is not possible to sniff the connection to see or modify any part of the data
stream (which is the purpose of the original proxy). Actually, HTTP streams can potentially be sniffed but not
HTTPS because it is encrypted.
<p>
There are a few reasons for using this proxy. The default DNS service supplied by your ISP may be unreliable or
it could be blocking certain domains. A site could also be blocked by taking down the DNS entry (to censor information
that the powers-that-be don't want you to see). However, bypassing the DNS service won't help if a site has been
deplatformed (banned by its ISP). There is only so much that we can do in the fight against censorship.
<p>
Of course, you could accomplish roughly the same thing by modifying your system DNS setting or the "hosts" file.
That approach is cumbersome and prone to error. The new Kraker proxy makes your changes much easier to set up
and modify on the fly. You will need to configure your web browser to work through the proxy. You can also do the same
for other applications that you use (if they support this).
<p>
<b><b_>Instructions for configuring a proxy connection in your web browser</b_></b>
<p>
<b><r_>Firefox</r_></b> - To get to the settings: Options >> General >> Network Settings >> Settings
<p><b>Check</b> "Manual proxy configuration"
<br><b>Uncheck</b> "Also use this proxy for FTP and HTTPS"
<br><b>Type</b> "localhost" in "SOCKS Host"
<br><b>Type</b> "8088" in the next field and <b>Check</b> "SOCKS v5"
<br><b>Check</b> "Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5"
<br><b>Ignore</b> "No proxy for" unless you have an issue
<br>All other fields should be left blank or unchecked
<br>Alternative: you can install the extension indicated for Chrome-based browsers below.
<p>
<b><r_>Waterfox</r_></b> - To get to the settings: Options >> Advanced >> Network >> Connection >> Settings
<p><b>Check</b> "Manual proxy configuration"
<br><b>Check</b> "Use this proxy server for all protocols"
<br><b>Type</b> "localhost" in "SOCKS Host"
<br><b>Type</b> "8088" in the next field and <b>Check</b> "SOCKS v5"
<br><b>Check</b> "Use proxy to perform DNS queries"
<br><b>Ignore</b> "No proxy for" unless you have an issue
<br>All other fields should be left blank or unchecked
<p>
<b><r_>Pale Moon</r_></b> - To get to the settings: Preferences >> Preferences >> Advanced >> Network >> Connection >> Settings
<p><b>Check</b> "Manual proxy configuration"
<br><b>Check</b> "Use this proxy server for all protocols"
<br><b>Type</b> "localhost" in "SOCKS Host"
<br><b>Type</b> "8088" in the next field and <b>Check</b> "SOCKS v5"
<br><b>Check</b> "Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5"
<br><b>Ignore</b> "No proxy for" unless you have an issue
<br>All other fields should be left blank or unchecked
<p>
<b><r_>Chrome-based browsers</r_></b> - You will need to install this
<a target="_blank" href="https://add0n.com/proxy-switcher.html">extension</a>.
<p>
There are versions of the extension for Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Edge. Even though you don't need it for Firefox,
I recommend it because it is easier to manage. Select the "Manual" tab once you have installed the extension. Enter a
profile name and fill all three proxy name fields with "localhost" and set the port number to "8088". Check "SOCKS v5"
and check "Remote DNS" (for Firefox only). Press the green checkmark symbol and you are done.
<p>
<b>Notes on The Onion Relay (TOR) Network</b>
<p>
Kraker supports accessing the TOR Network either for specific domains or globally. Also, "onion" links will automatically
be routed to a TOR server. There are two ways to get a TOR server running: open the Tor Browser or run the stand-alone
TOR server. The two cannot run together and the port number differs. It is port 9150 with the Tor Browser and port 9050
with the stand-alone. Go <a target="_blank" href="https://www.torproject.org/download/tor/">here</a> to download. The
browser is available for Windows, Linux, Mac and Android but the stand-alone is only available for Windows.
<p>
Extract the zip file for the stand-alone TOR server. Find "tor.exe" in the "Tor" folder and run it. That's all. Personally,
I don't like having another console alongside Kraker so I'll be looking for a way to run the TOR server invisibly. For now,
this works fine.
<p>
You can set up TOR as your proxy if you like. Just use port "9050" or "9150" instead of "8088". Everything will then be
routed directly through the TOR network. I'm not recommending this. While your IP address will be rendered anonymous,
there are still potential privacy issues. If you want to roam the "Darknet" then use the Tor Browser. Also, your IP address
will change routinely, usually every 15 minutes. This will mess up any login or verification credentials that may be based
on your IP address. Certainly not good for online banking unless you can get it done swiftly.
<p>
<b><b_>Working with the proxy settings file</b_></b>
<p>
The file is named "_settings.txt" and you should have copied it to your Kraker folder. If not, go back and get it.
<p>
There are four data types: 1) Option Flag, 2) DNS Service, 3) Domain Lookup and 4) IP Address List.
<p>
<b><r_>Option Flag</r_></b> has the format <r_>$name=0$</r_> (change '0' to '1' to enable). There are five flags:
<table>
<tr><td><b>fmodify</b></td><td>If enabled then the other flags may be modified when the settings file is reloaded.
The flags are initialized on startup.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>console</b></td><td>If enabled then each connection opened in the proxy will be reported in the console
(name, port, IP address).</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>altport</b></td><td>If enabled then the proxy will invoke the TOR server at port 9150 (Tor Browser)
else 9050 (stand-alone).
<tr><td><b>tor4all</b></td><td>If enabled then every connection will be proxied through the TOR server.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>$end$</b></td><td>Special flag that marks the end of your settings.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<b><r_>DNS Service</r_></b> has the format <r_>[#name ipaddr1 ipaddr2]</r_> where "name" is any name you wish to use
to select the service, "ipaddr1" is the primary server and "ipaddr2" is the backup server. The service named "default"
will be selected automatically on startup.
<p>
<b><r_>Domain Lookup</r_></b> has the format <r_>[?name domain1|domain2 ipaddr ...]</r_> where "name" is any name you
wish to use to group one or more entries. If the name is omitted then the entry will be assimilated on startup or a reload.
Multiple domains may be specified with a separating vertical bar. If more than one IP address is specified then one will
be selected randomly. The special form "+name" may be used to include an IP Address List. Mixing is allowed. That is,
IP addresses and one or more groups may be included. The special value "TOR" invokes the TOR server. If no IP address
is provided then a DNS lookup will be performed to get one (but not for a nameless entry).
<p>
<b><r_>IP Address List</r_></b> has the format <r_>[+name ipaddr ...]</r_> where "name" is any name you wish to use to
include the list in a Domain Lookup. Any number of IP addresses may appear. They may be separated with spaces,
tabs or new lines. Invalid IP addresses will be ignored.
<p>
<b><b_>The proxy server command interface</b_></b>
<p>
You can send commands to the proxy server on port 8080 as follows:
<p>
<g_>http://localhost:8080/?activate=X</g_> where "X" is the name of a Domain Lookup group. More than one group may be
specified (separated with a comma). If no IP address has been specified for a domain then a DNS lookup will be performed.
The list of the activated domains will appear on the console. Domains that have already been activated will be refreshed.
If "X" is blank then the nameless group will be refreshed (already activated from startup or a reload). The DNS lookup
does not apply to this group.
<p>
<g_>http://localhost:8080/?dnslookup=X</g_> where "X" is either a domain name (a full URL is permitted) or an IP address
(for a reverse DNS lookup).
<p>
<g_>http://localhost:8080/?flags=X</g_> where "X" is a number in the range 0 to 7 to enable/disable the option flags:
console = 1, altport = 2, tor4all = 4. Add up the numbers to combine the flags. The new flag settings will be shown.
If "X" is blank then no flags will be changed.
<p>
<g_>http://localhost:8080/?reload=X</g_> where "X" is the name of a settings file or "_settings.txt" if blank. This is not
exactly the same as loading the settings file on startup. The "default" DNS Service will not be invoked and Option Flags
do not apply unless <r_>$fmodify=1$</r_> has been specified.
<p>
<g_>http://localhost:8080/?servers=X</g_> where "X" is the name of a DNS Service (optional) which will be used for all DNS
lookups (this bypasses your system DNS setting). The special name "reset" is used to restore the system DNS setting.
The output is a list of the activated domains. The "default" DNS Service is not invoked automatically on a settings file
reload but you can do so with this command.
<p>

<b>Notes</b>
<p>
<ul><li>
The DNS settings also apply to the proxy server at port 8080 except that the TOR network cannot be used.
</li><li>
The new version of the 8kun Bread Launcher has a convenient proxy control panel. It is pretty basic but cool.
