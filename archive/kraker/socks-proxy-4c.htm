<h3 style="margin:0"><r_>Using and configuring the Socks5 Tunnel Proxy Server</r_></h3>
<p><hr><p>
This document covers browser configuration and the features specific to DNS management. There are some advanced
features, mainly intended for website hacking, which are only documented in the main Kraker manual.
<p>
<a href="manual-kraker-v3.htm">Instruction manual for the Kraker Local Proxy Server</a>
<p>
The <g_>8kun Bread Launcher</g_> comes with a handy proxy control panel to help simplify your DNS management activities.
It's pretty basic but I use it all the time. I'll be releasing a better stand-alone tool sometime in the future but it's
not a priority project.

<p><hr><p>

<b>Addendum</b> (August 1, 2022) -- upgrade from version 4b to version 4c (no changes from v4a to v4b)
<p>
<b>I have addressed two security vulnerabilities:</b>
<p>
1) Previously, a failed DNS request would default to the system DNS just in case the domain name happened to be
something that could only be resolved at the system level. This is an issue due to the fact that an attacker may attempt
to locate the user's DNS host by forcing arbitrary DNS lookups which feed back to the attacker's server. This is fine
as long as the DNS resolves but, otherwise, it is not fine since the user's default DNS service (likely the ISP)
would be exposed. The new policy is to block any domain which does not resolve. Users who have local domains installed
may flag them as "LOCAL" in the settings file (dotless domain names and domain names ending with ".localhost" are flagged
automatically).
<p>
2) The "reload" command allows the user to load DNS settings from a file other than the default. The vulnerability is
that it is possible for an attacker to create an arbitrary file in the Kraker home directory and then load that file
with the "reload" command, thus effectively taking over the user's DNS. The new policy is to block any file names
which are not pre-declared (see the section on Option Flags).
<p>
<b>Alternative Internet services</b> - One of my goals with the Kraker Local Proxy Server is to provide a single point
of access to alternative Internet services (Tor Network being the first offering). I have investigated a number of
candidates but, so far, there isn't much to get excited about. Here is what Kraker supports at this point (I have also
tried Freenet but it has performance issues like IPFS).
<p>
<b>I2P (Invisible Internet Project)</b> - The proxy server will automatically route ".i2p" domains to your local I2P
server if you have one installed and running. This feature expects the I2P server to be available at localhost port 4444.
I have found the I2P server to be very efficient and reliable. However, many I2P sites tend to be down most of the
time and I haven't found any to be worth my time. Still, it is something to keep an eye on.
<p>
<b>IPFS (Inter Planetary File System)</b> - The IPFS local server installs at "localhost:8080" which is in conflict
with Kraker. Co-existence requires that the IPFS server be configured for port 8089. Kraker will detect URL
paths beginning with "/ipfs/" or "/ipns/" and automatically reroute such a request to "localhost:8089" so that IPFS
links directed to "localhost:8080" will work correctly. My experience with IPFS has been disappointing. There are
serious performance issues (with both the local server and the Internet gateways). In particular, the local server
overloads my router with too many open sockets and that takes down my Internet access. I have tried every
possible configuration but performance remains an issue.
<p>
<b>Lokinet</b> - The ".loki" and ".snode" domains are automatically flagged as "LOCAL" for users who may be running the
Lokinet server which installs at the level of the system DNS. I do not recommend Lokinet and have not seen any use case
for it. It has a tendency to go into a never-ending loop thus forcing a shutdown. I'm also leery about the fact that
it installs as a virtual network card and that it takes over the system DNS. This is overkill. Besides that, I'm not
seeing much enthusiasm from the developers. Maybe it's a dead project.

<p><hr><p>

<b>Addendum</b> (May 15, 2022) -- upgrade from version 3b to version 4a
<p>
This version is a major upgrade but there isn't much that affects this document. The HTTP (8080), HTTPS (8081) and
Socks5 (8088) server ports have been integrated. The HTTP and HTTPS ports route through the Socks5 port so all of the
DNS settings (including TOR) fully apply. Wildcard domains are now supported. The new "shadow port" feature allows
connections through Socks5 to be routed through the HTTP and HTTPS ports.
<p>
You can now access I2P websites
without a special browser configuration. The Socks5 proxy server will detect the ".i2p" top-level domain and route
the request to "localhost:4444" which is where the I2P server is normally located.

<p><hr><p>

<b>Addendum</b> (November 19, 2021) -- upgrade from version 3a to version 3b
<p>
This is a premature release due to an incompatibility that I discovered. Version 3a is not compatible with Node.js
version 16 which was initially released in April. I'm not in the habit of testing every version of Node.js to make
sure that something like this doesn't happen. Also, nobody talks to me to let me know about stuff like this. Oh well.
<p>
Anyway, there is one small change which is pertinent to the Socks5 proxy. A new flag has been added to enable
the monitoring of the DoH/DNS activity. The flag is meant to be used with the console output disabled. If it is enabled,
then socket activity will be displayed. This is pretty much useless at this point so I won't bother describing it.
I used it to fix the memory leak problem when sockets were not being closed correctly.

<p><hr><p>

<b>Addendum</b> (May 8, 2021) -- upgrade from version 2c to version 3a
<p>
This is the final version of the Socks5 proxy server. The DNS lookup function has been extended to support up to four
simultaneous lookups. I discovered that there can be a delay of 5 to 6 seconds in a DNS response. I don't understand the
cause of this but got some interesting results with a search on "dns delay 5 seconds". Also, I have included support for
"DNS over HTTPS" but only in the JSON format (which is not widely available). It is simply not worth the effort to support
the standard format which is a binary format. The DoH lookup is not used for the "dnslookup" command.
<p>
I uncovered another memory leak, this time in the original port 8080 server for Alleycat Player. This is interesting
because I followed the standard procedure for handling an HTTP/HTTPS connection. Nowhere, not even in the official
documentation, is it mentioned that the connection should be "destroyed" to avoid a memory leak. This is the same thing
which led to a memory leak in the Socks5 proxy. That was fixed by called the "destroy" function when either the incoming
or outgoing connection is closed. The issue with the port 8080 server was uncovered by seeking through a proxied mp4 video.
If the browser closes the connection while buffered data is still in the server's memory, the memory is not properly
released. The normal memory footprint for Node.js is under 15 megabytes and sometimes as little as 8 megabytes. Memory
usage goes up when the server is buffering content but then should drop quickly once the content is consumed or
the connection is closed.

<p><hr><p>

<b>Addendum</b> (April 8, 2021) -- upgrade from version 2b to version 2c
<p>
Two major issues have been fixed. First, there was a memory leak due to the failure to destroy spent sockets (not a serious
problem but up to 20 megabytes of memory was being wasted). Second, a custom DNS lookup procedure has been implemented. It
turns out that Node.js performs an internal DNS lookup via the operating system. Thus, the DNS server settings in your
settings file did not apply though they do apply to the "dnslookup" command. The new DNS lookup procedure applies the
following policies:
<ul><li>
The IP address resulting from a DNS lookup is retained for a minimum period of 5 minutes.
</li><li>
Access to the DNS server is serialized. That is, only one lookup can be in progress at one time.
</li><li>
In the event of a DNS failure, the default Node.js DNS lookup via the operating system will be invoked.
</li></ul>
The process has been fine-tuned to maximize performance and to limit the need to access the DNS server. There are no
user options and no option to disable. There is no reason to disable since the default DNS lookup procedure in Node.js
is inefficient and prone to failure due to resource contention.
<p><hr><p>
<b>The remainder of this document has been updated to reflect the above changes.</b>

<p><hr><p>

The Kraker Socks5 server is referred to as a "Tunnel Proxy" because all it does (or can do) is apply a custom DNS lookup
and then route the connection to the required destination. It is not possible to sniff the connection to see or modify any
part of the data stream (which is the purpose of the original proxy). Actually, HTTP streams can potentially be sniffed
but not HTTPS because it is encrypted.
<p>
There are a few reasons for using this proxy. The default DNS service supplied by your ISP may be unreliable or
it could be blocking certain domains. A site could also be blocked by taking down the DNS entry (to censor information
that the powers-that-be don't want you to see). However, bypassing the DNS service won't help if a site has been
deplatformed (banned by its ISP). There is only so much that we can do in the fight against censorship.
<p>
Of course, you could accomplish roughly the same thing by modifying your system DNS setting or the "hosts" file.
That approach is cumbersome and prone to error. The new Kraker proxy makes your changes much easier to set up
and modify on the fly. You will need to configure your web browser to work through the proxy. You can also do the same
for other applications that you use (if they support this).

<p><hr><p>

<b><b_>Instructions for configuring a proxy connection in your web browser</b_></b>
<p>
<b><r_>Firefox</r_></b> - To get to the settings: Tools >> Settings >> General > Network Settings > Settings
<p><b>Check</b> "Manual proxy configuration"
<br><b>Uncheck</b> "Also use this proxy for FTP and HTTPS"
<br><b>Type</b> "localhost" in "SOCKS Host"
<br><b>Type</b> "8088" in the next field and <b>Check</b> "SOCKS v5"
<br><b>Check</b> "Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5"
<br><b>Ignore</b> "No proxy for" unless you have an issue
<br>All other fields should be left blank or unchecked
<br>Alternative: you can install the extension indicated for Chrome-based browsers below.
<p>
<b><r_>Waterfox</r_></b> - To get to the settings: Tools >> Options >> Advanced >> Network > Connection > Settings
<p><b>Check</b> "Manual proxy configuration"

<b><r_>Pale Moon</r_></b> - To get to the settings: Preferences >> Preferences >> Advanced >> Network > Connection > Settings
<p><b>Check</b> "Manual proxy configuration"
<br><b>Check</b> "Use this proxy server for all protocols"
<br><b>Type</b> "localhost" in "SOCKS Host"

<p>
<b><r_>Chrome-based browsers</r_></b> - You will need to install this
<a target="_blank" href="https://add0n.com/proxy-switcher.html">extension</a>.
<p>
There are versions of the extension for Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Edge. Even though you don't need it for Firefox,
I recommend it because it is easier to manage. Select the "Manual" tab once you have installed the extension. Enter a
profile name and fill all three proxy name fields with "localhost" and set the port number to "8088". Check "SOCKS v5"
and check "Remote DNS" (for Firefox only). Press the green checkmark symbol and you are done.

<p><hr><p>

<b><b_>The Onion Relay (Tor) Network</b_></b>
<p>
Kraker supports accessing the Tor Network either for specific domains or globally. Also, "onion" links will automatically
be routed to a Tor server. There are two ways to get a Tor server running: open the Tor Browser or run the stand-alone
Tor server. The two cannot run together and the port number differs. It is port 9150 with the Tor Browser and port 9050
with the stand-alone. Go <a target="_blank" href="https://www.torproject.org/download/tor/">here</a> to download. The
browser is available for Windows, Linux, Mac and Android but the stand-alone is only available for Windows.
<p>
Extract the zip file for the stand-alone Tor server. Find "tor.exe" in the "Tor" folder and run it. That's all. Personally,
I don't like having another console alongside Kraker so I'll be looking for a way to run the Tor server invisibly. For now,
this works fine.
<p>
<b>New information:</b> you can start the Tor server in a hidden window if you have the Tor Browser
installed. This is the same server that starts up with the browser but it defaults to port 9050 instead of 9150.
Find the Tor server in the folder where you installed the browser:
<p>
<g_>Tor/Browser/TorBrowser/Tor/tor.exe</g_> <r_>(your installation might differ)</r_>
<p>
You can set up Tor as your proxy if you like. Just use port 9050 or 9150 (instead of 8088 for Kraker). Everything will
then be routed directly through the Tor network. I'm not recommending this. While your IP address will be rendered
anonymous, there are still potential privacy issues. If you want to roam the "Darknet" then use the Tor Browser. Also,
your IP address will change routinely, usually every 15 minutes. This will mess up any login or verification credentials
that may be based on your IP address. Certainly not good for online banking unless you can get it done swiftly.

<p><hr><p>

<b><b_>Working with the proxy settings file</b_></b>
<p>
The file is named "_settings.txt" and you should have copied it to your Kraker folder. If not, go back and get it.
<p>
There are four data types: 1) Option Flag, 2) DNS Service, 3) Domain Lookup and 4) IP Address List.
<p>
<b><r_>Option Flag</r_></b> has the format <r_>$name=0$</r_> (change '0' to '1' to enable). There are five flags:
<table>
<tr><td><b>fmodify</b></td><td>If enabled then the other flags may be modified when the settings file is reloaded.
The flags are initialized on startup.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>console</b></td><td>If enabled then each connection opened in the proxy will be reported in the console
(name, port, IP address).</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>showdns</b></td><td>If enabled then DoH/DNS activity will be displayed on the console. If console output
is enabled, then socket activity will be displayed.
<tr><td><b>altport</b></td><td>If enabled then the proxy will invoke the Tor server at port 9150 (Tor Browser)
else 9050 (stand-alone).
<tr><td><b>tor4all</b></td><td>If enabled then all connections will be passed through the Tor server (except for
domains flagged as "LOCAL").</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>$end$</b></td><td>Special flag that marks the end of your settings.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<b><r_>New features</r_> (valid only in <g_>_settings.txt</g_>):</b>
<table>
<tr><td><b>$shadow_secret=<r_>password</r_>$</b></td><td>Secret password for some restricted shadow port management
  options (added in v4a).</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>$settings=<r_>filename|filename2</r_>$</b></td><td>List of allowed settings file names separated by a
  vertical bar (added in v4c).</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<b><r_>DNS Service</r_></b> has the format [<g_>#name ipaddr1 ipaddr2</g_>] where "name" is any name you wish to use
to select the service, "ipaddr1" is the primary server and "ipaddr2" is the backup server. The service named "default"
will be selected automatically on startup. For DoH (DNS over HTTPS), "ipaddr2" must be a string containing the domain
name and the service name (for example, "dns.google/resolve"). The server must support the JSON format.
<p>
<b><r_>Domain Lookup</r_></b> has the format [<g_>?name domain1|domain2 ipaddr ...</g_>] where "name" is any name you
wish to use to group one or more entries. If the name is omitted then the entry will be assimilated on startup or a
reload. Multiple domains may be specified with a separating vertical bar. A domain name beginning with a dot may be
used as a wildcard. For example, ".youtube.com" includes "youtube.com" and "www.youtube.com". If more than one
IP address is specified then one will be selected randomly. The special form "+name" may be used to include an
IP Address List. Mixing is allowed. That is, IP addresses and one or more Lists may be included.
<p>
The special IP address "0.0.0.0" may be used to block a domain. The special value "FETCH" will invoke a DNS pre-fetch.
The special value "LOCAL" forces the DNS lookup to default to the system DNS (this is automatic for a dotless domain
name or a domain name ending with ".localhost"). The special values "TOR" or "VPN" may be used to route the connection
through a Socks5 proxy server. In the case of "TOR", the server address is local (the Tor server is running on the
user's machine). For the "VPN" option, you need to use the "vpn" command to specify the server address (see the next
section). In general, it is recommended that the DNS lookup be left to the proxy server but the following options
are available:
<p>
<g_>TOR:</g_> (local DNS lookup) or <g_>VPN:1.2.3.4</g_> (IP address) or <g_>VPN+name</g_> (IP Address List)
<p>
<b><r_>IP Address List</r_></b> has the format [<g_>+name ipaddr ...</g_>] where "name" is any name you wish to use to
include the list in a Domain Lookup. Any number of IP addresses may appear. They may be separated with spaces,
tabs or new lines. Invalid IP addresses will be ignored.

<p><hr><p>

<b><b_>The proxy server command interface</b_></b>
<p>
You can send commands to the proxy server on port 8080 as follows:
<p>
<g_>http://localhost:8080/?activate=X</g_> where "X" is the name of a Domain Lookup group. More than one group may be
specified (separated with a comma). Domains that have already been activated will be refreshed. If "X" is blank then
the nameless group will be activated.
<p>
<g_>http://localhost:8080/?dnslookup=X</g_> where "X" is either a domain name (a full URL is permitted) or an IP address
(for a reverse DNS lookup). The DoH (DNS over HTTPS) configuration is not used. To switch the DNS Service, prepend "X"
with the name of the Service and "=".
<p>
<g_>http://localhost:8080/?flags=X</g_> where "X" is a number in the range 0 to 31: console = 1, altport = 2, tor4all = 4,
showdns = 16. Add up the numbers to combine the flags. The new flag settings will be shown. If "X" is blank then no flags
will be changed.
<p>
<g_>http://localhost:8080/?reload=X</g_> where "X" is the name of a settings file or "_settings.txt" if blank. This is not
exactly the same as loading the settings file on startup. The "default" DNS Service will not be invoked and Option Flags
do not apply unless <r_>$fmodify=1$</r_> has been specified.
<p>
<b>New for version 4c:</b> only pre-approved file names are
allowed (see $settings$ option above). This fixes a security vulnerability.
<p>
<g_>http://localhost:8080/?servers=X</g_> where "X" is the name of a DNS Service (or blank). The special name "reset"
is used to restore the DNS service specified by your ISP (Internet Service Provider). Use this command to view
the list of activated domains without effecting changes.
<p>
<g_>http://localhost:8080/?vpn=X</g_> where "X" is a Socks5 proxy server address in the form "ip:port:username:password"
(or simply "ip:port"). If "X" is blank then the current proxy setting will be shown (an invalid "X" will remove it). The
"tor4all" flag may be used to force all connections through the proxy (except for domains flagged as "TOR" or "LOCAL").
If no proxy has been specified then any domains flagged as "VPN" will connect without a proxy (regardless of "tor4all").
A Socks5 proxy is useful for hiding your IP address but it is not the same as a true VPN (Virtual Private Network).
Free Socks5 proxies are available but they are usually unreliable. Good proxies can be found if you search long and
hard enough (hint, hint).

<p><hr><p>

<b><b_>Notes</b_></b>
<p>
<ul><li>
The DNS resolver supports (up to four) simultaneous lookups for both standard DNS and DNS-over-HTTPS.
</li><li>
The DNS settings also apply to the proxy server at port 8080 and port 8081 because they connect through the Socks5 port.
</li><li>
The IP address resulting from a DNS lookup is cached for a minimum period of 5 minutes and up to 10 minutes (depending
on whether a DNS lookup is in progress when the cache is inspected). This policy is a "best fit" because there is no such
thing as a perfect DNS caching policy.
</li></ul>
